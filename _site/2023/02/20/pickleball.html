<div class = "normal_text"><p>Pickleball is an indoor or outdoor racket/paddle sport where two players (singles), or four players (doubles), hit a perforated hollow polymer ball over a 36-inch-high (0.91 m) net using solid-faced paddles. Opponents on either side of the net hit the ball back and forth until one side commits a rule infraction. Pickleball was invented in 1965 as a childrenâ€™s backyard game on Bainbridge Island, Washington, US. In 2022, pickleball was adopted as the official state sport of Washington.</p>
