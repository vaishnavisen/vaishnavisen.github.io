<center><img class ="img_adjust" src="/assets/images/vaish_akira_nature_center.jpeg"></center>

I am Vaishnavi. I am a data scientist at Bon Secours Mercy Health, where I build tools to deliver insights about the workforce. I have a rambunctious and loving golden retriever named Akira, who keeps me busy after work. I am a stationery nerd, I indulge in fountain pens and planners and washi tapes. 

My interests include personal fitness, nutrition and sustainable living. I am a long time yoga practitioner and a recent pickleball enthusiast.
