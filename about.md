title: About Me
---

I am Vaishnavi. I am an Indian living in the USA. I am a data scientist and I build tools to deliver insights about the workforce at Bon Secours Mercy Health. I have a rambunctious and loving golden retriever named Akira, who keeps me busy after work. I am a stationery nerd, I indulge in fountain pens and planners and washi tapes. My other interests include personal fitness, nutrition and athleisure. I am a long time yoga practitioner and a recent pickleball enthusiast. ![Vaish and Akira at Nature Center](/assets/images/vaish_akira_nature_center.jpeg)
