title: Flying your dog from USA to India as excess baggage
---

A couple of months ago, I found out I had to move from the USA to India temporarily. I had no idea how long 'temporary' was. A dog owner's nightmare! After much thought, I decided to take my 65 pound golden retriever with me to India in an airplane as excess baggage. I spent the following months preparing for our travel and making sure I had everything to ensure a smooth journey for my dog. On the day of our flight, my dog's documents were checked by the airlines' employees and he was ready to be boarded. Great! They then looked at my passport and asked me for a transit visa that I didn't have. Not great! Unfortunately, we could not fly that day. So, while I can't tell you what happens after checking in your dog, I can definitely take you through how we got there. 

I. Manifest Cargo vs Excess Baggage

There are two options to fly your dog internationally - excess baggage and manifest cargo. With excess baggage, the dog is linked to the owner's flight booking. With manifest cargo, the dog needs a separate booking. Airlines usually require a professional pet relocation company to do the booking. The company handles the entire process on your behalf, making this the least stressful and the most expensive option. For my situation, I chose excess cargo with Lufthansa airlines. When I booked my flight ticket, I requested a spot for my dog. After confirming there was space available in the cargo, the agent asked a couple of questions about my dog, size of his crate etc. and added my dog to the ticket. My dog's reservation was also mentioned on the itinerary emailed to me.

Each airline has its own rules and restrictions regarding dog breed, dog weight, size of the crate etc. Some airlines even require live animals to be transported only as manifest cargo. It is important to make the reservation as early as possible to avoid last minute surprises.
 

II. Choosing the right departure location

I live in Cincinnati, but I could not fly from the closest airport which is the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG). Two big reasons for this: 

i. To avoid multiple airline and codeshare flights

During international travel, it is common to have multiple airlines involved. But pet travel policies are specific to the airlines operating the flight and it is the pet owner's responsibility to confirm that all airlines involved are ready to fly the pet. Every flight option from CVG involved multiple airlines. And some of them did not even fly pets anymore. A six hour drive to the bigger airport in Chicago opened more possibilities, and so I made my reservation to fly from the Chicago airport. 

ii. Weather

A couple of days after I made the flight reservation, I learnt about 'weather embargoes'. Airlines have temperature restrictions for flying pets to ensure their safety during extreme weather conditions. If the temperature goes above or below safe levels, the airline can refuse to fly the pet. This is to avoid exposing the pet to harsh temperatures while moving him or her between the terminal and the aircraft. Breeds tolerant to cold weather might be allowed to fly with an [acclimation certificate](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/acclimation-certificatesstatements) from a [US Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved vet](https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/vsps/public/VetSearch.do). But in dangerously cold conditions, the airlines can still refuse to fly them for obvious reasons. And weather embargoes apply to both departure and destination locations.

Flying from the Windy city during January sounded like the perfect recipe for a cold weather embargo. So I decided to go down south and fly from Atlanta, where the temperature was forecasted to be in the 50s on the day of our flight.  

 
II. CRATE

i. Figuring out the right crate size

After quickly realizing that the foldable metal crate I had lying at home, unused in a long time, cannot be used for flying, I looked for a plastic crate specifically built for air travel. I used the [standard formula](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/b0016da92c86449f850fe9560827bbea/pet-container-requirements.pdf) to calculate the size for my dog. My golden retriever weighs around 65 pounds, but he is longer than most dogs that weigh the same. For his dimensions, the [48 inch crate](https://www.petmate.com/petmate-sky-kennel/product/PM09) was the suitable choice. The monstrosity of the crate and the logistic challenges it was going to create were intimidating. But as someone who is claustrophobic when flying in airplanes, I knew there was no such thing as 'too much space' during a ~24 hour journey in the dark cargo hold. I bought the giant 48 inch crate as early as I could.    

ii. Getting your dog used to the crate

My dog hates the crate. Period. I knew he was never going to completely like his new plastic crate but I had a couple of months to atleast make him feel not-uncomfortable in it. I started feeding all his meals inside the crate and dropped a lot of treats. The usual crate training stuff. 


IV. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED


V. DAY OF FLIGHT

i. Preparing the crate for the flight 

The crate came with a couple of 'Live Animals' stickers and a form to indicate when the animal was last fed. I stuck the 'Live Animal' stickers on the front and sides of the crate. I referred to a couple of videos on YouTube for guidance. There were also two small plastic bowls that came with the crate - one for food and one for water. I thought they were too small for the ~24 hour journey and bought [bigger ones (2.5 cups)](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/bowls-and-feeders/top-paw-crate-crock-feeding-bowl-51192.html?cgid=100402&fmethod=Browse). I attached them to the crate door and the design was perfect for the task in hand. I lined the bottom of the crate with pee pads, so that the crate would remain dry in case there were potty accidents. Finally, I put a blanket on top, one that I had been using the past few days, hoping that my scent would comfort my dog in the dark and noisy cargo hold.

This document has some very detailed information about how to prepare the crate for the flight.

ii. Packing food for layover

I filled a ziplock bag with a meal worth of dry food and attached it to the top of the crate. I also had a bottle of water ready to be attached to the crate at the airport.

iii. Driving to the airport and Checking in

My extremely kind friend drove us to the Atlanta airport on the day of our flight. The 48 inch crate had to be disassembled to fit in a Volvo XC90 along with my luggage. We did not hit any major traffic on the way and reached Atlanta on time. We made a stop near the airport for a potty break for my dog before the flight. 

At the airport curb, we quickly put the crate back together. My friend loaded it on an airport cart - the crate was unproportionally large for the cart, but it somehow worked. Together, we took the crate, my luggage and my dog who was on leash to the Lufthansa economy check in counter. My dog was totally enjoying this new experience, blissfully unaware of what I had planned for his next 24 hours. The airline agent asked for his NOC certificate, rabies vaccination certificate and acclimation certificate. After verifying the documents, the agents quickly checked my dog's crate. They confirmed that everything looked good and affixed more stickers on the crate.  

The focus then shifted to my documents and we found out that I needed a transit visa to travel through Germany, even if I wasn't going to get out of Frankfurt airport. The expired visa stamping in my passport or the supplemental documentation that proved my US visa was still valid would not be accepted. I wished that I had found out about this rule earlier, but there was nothing we could do then other than to go home, which we did. My friend drove another 7 hours to take us back home. We hit some intense fog on the way back but reached home safe. The day had become memorable for so many reasons.


When going through this incredibly stressful experience, I was constantly searching for resources that covered all the aspects of this process at the required level of detail. But beyond high level articles published by pet relocation companies, I could not find much. My goal for this post was to document the process and experience from the perspective of a dog owner in hopes that it will help someone in the future.
