title: I tried to fly my dog from the USA to India
---

Spoiler Alert! I failed.

A couple of months ago, I found out I had to move from the USA to India temporarily. I had no idea how long 'temporary' was. A dog owner's nightmare! After much thought, I decided to take my 65 pound golden retriever with me to India in an airplane as excess baggage. I spent the following months preparing for our travel and making sure I had everything to ensure a smooth journey for my dog. On the day of our flight, my dog's documents were checked by the airlines' employees and he was ready to be boarded. Great! They then looked at my passport and asked me for a transit visa that I didn't have. Not great! Unfortunately, we could not fly that day. But I was so close, close enough for me to believe that sharing my experience here is valuable.  

### Manifest Cargo vs Excess Baggage

There are two options to fly your dog internationally - excess baggage and manifest cargo. With excess baggage, the dog is linked to the owner's flight booking. With manifest cargo, the dog needs a separate booking. Airlines usually require a professional pet relocation company to do the booking. The company handles the entire process on your behalf, making this the least stressful and the most expensive option. For my situation, I chose excess cargo with Lufthansa airlines. When booking my flight ticket, I also requested a spot for my dog. After confirming there was space available in the cargo, the agent asked a couple of questions about my dog, size of his crate etc. and added my dog to the ticket. This was also mentioned on the itinerary emailed to me.

Each airline has its own rules and restrictions regarding dog breeds, weight, size of the crate etc. Some airlines even require live animals to be transported only as manifest cargo. It is important to make the reservation as early as possible to avoid last minute surprises.

### Choosing the right departure location

I live in Cincinnati, but I could not fly from the closest airport - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG). Two big reasons for this: 

#### i. Multiple airline flights and codeshare flights are complicated for pet travel

During international travel, it is common to have multiple airlines involved. But pet travel policies are specific to the airlines operating the flight and it is the pet owner's responsibility to confirm that all airlines involved are ready to fly the pet. Every flight option from CVG involved multiple airlines. And some of them did not even fly pets anymore. A six hour drive to the bigger airport in Chicago opened more possibilities, and so I made my reservation to fly from there. 

#### ii. Weather

A couple of days after I made the flight reservation, I learnt about 'weather embargoes'. Airlines have temperature restrictions for flying pets to ensure their safety during extreme weather conditions. If the temperature goes above or below safe levels, the airline can refuse to fly the pet. This is to avoid exposing the pet to harsh temperatures while moving him or her between the terminal and the aircraft. Breeds tolerant to cold weather might be allowed to fly with an [acclimation certificate](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/acclimation-certificatesstatements) from a [US Department of Agriculture (USDA) accredited vet](https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/vsps/public/VetSearch.do). But in dangerously cold conditions, the airlines can still refuse to fly them for obvious reasons. And weather embargoes apply to both departure and destination locations.

Flying from the Windy city during January sounded like the perfect recipe for a cold weather embargo. So I decided to go down south and fly from Atlanta, where the temperature was forecasted to be in the 50s on the day of our flight. Thankfully, a Lufthansa flight was available from the Atlanta airport on the same date. Lufthansa customer service changed my reservation for a fee.

### Documents Required

There are [country specific entry requirements](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/by-country/pettravel-india) for exporting pets from the USA. Documents should be presented to the airlines staff during check-in and the quarantine officer in customs after landing.

1. USDA endorsed Health Certificate
     
    I reached out to my USDA accredited vet's office and they were ready to help get this one. I made an appointment with the vet, he confirmed my dog was fit to travel. He completed the [Health Certific     ate  form for India](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/health-certificates/non-eu/india-dogs.pdf) and submitted it digitally to the USDA for endorsement. It took ~4 days to receive the endorsed ce    rticate  online (my vet followed up with the USDA office over the phone) and it was valid for 30 days. I did hear that some USDA offices provide only a 10 day validity.
       
2. Vaccination Record
     
    This is a certificate from the vet confirming my dog had been given all required vaccines, i.e. [Rabies](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/pdf/nasphv_form51_1.pdf) and DAPP (Distemper, Adenovirus, Parainflue    nza , Parvo) along with the dates they were administered.
     
3. No Objection Certificate (NOC)
     
    I hired an [Indian pet relocator](http://globalcargo.co.in/contact.html) to help get this one from the Animal Quarantine and Certification Services(AQCS) in India. They needed the following documents     at  least 7 days before the flight:
   
    * USDA Health certificate 
    * Vaccination record
    * My passport and visa documents
    * Ticket to India
    * A letter from my employer confirming the reason for my move 
    * A photo of my dog
    * My address in India  
     
    They also asked me to confirm that:
   
    - I had been in the USA for atleast the last 2 years and any short visits to India were not more than a total of 180 days 
    - I won't return to the USA with my dog for at least 3-4 months
     
    They verified all the documents and submitted them to the AQCS office, who then quickly provided the No Objection Certificate. I emailed copies to the airline offices at the origin and destination air    ports before the flight.
     
4. Acclimation certificate:
     
    Our layover was at Frankfurt, which is cold in January. So I requested my vet to provide an [acclimation certificate](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/acclimation-certificatesstateme    nts ).

Due to the time sensitive nature of the process, there were tense moments while getting the documents ready. Hiring a pet relocator to get the NOC was definitely worth it.

### Buying a correctly sized air travel crate

After quickly realizing that the foldable metal crate I already had, unused in a long time, cannot be used for flying, I looked for a plastic crate specifically built for air travel. I used the [standard formula](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/b0016da92c86449f850fe9560827bbea/pet-container-requirements.pdf) to calculate the size my dog needed. My golden retriever weighs around 65 pounds, but he is longer than most dogs that weigh the same. For his dimensions, the [48 inch crate](https://www.petmate.com/petmate-sky-kennel/product/PM09) seemed like the right choice. The monstrosity of the crate and the logistic challenges it was going to create were intimidating. But as someone who is claustrophobic when flying in airplanes, I knew there was no such thing as 'too much space' during a ~24 hour journey in the dark cargo hold. I bought the giant 48 inch crate as early as I could.    
 
### Getting your dog used to the crate

My dog hates the crate. Period. I knew he was never going to completely like his new plastic crate. But I had a couple of months to at least make him feel not-uncomfortable in it. I started feeding all his meals inside the crate and dropped a lot of treats. The usual crate training stuff. 

### Preparing the crate for the flight 

The crate came with a couple of 'Live Animals' stickers and a form to indicate when the animal was last fed. I stuck the 'Live Animal' stickers on the front and sides of the crate. I referred to a couple of videos on YouTube for guidance. There were also two small plastic bowls that came with the crate - one for food and one for water. I thought they were too small for the ~24 hour journey and bought [bigger ones (2.5 cups)](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/bowls-and-feeders/top-paw-crate-crock-feeding-bowl-51192.html?cgid=100402&fmethod=Browse). I attached them to the crate door and the design was perfect. I lined the bottom of the crate with pee pads, so that it would remain dry in case of potty accidents. I then put a blanket on top, one that I had been using the past few days, hoping that my scent would comfort my dog in the dark and noisy cargo hold.

[This document](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/b0016da92c86449f850fe9560827bbea/pet-container-requirements.pdf) has some very detailed information about how to prepare the crate for the flight.

### Packing food for layover

I filled a ziplock bag with a meal worth of dry food and attached it to the top of the crate. I also had a bottle of water ready to be attached to the crate at the airport.

### Driving to the airport and checking in

My kind friend drove us to the Atlanta airport on the day of our flight. The 48 inch crate was disassembled to fit in a Volvo XC90 along with my luggage. We did not hit any major traffic on the way and reached Atlanta on time. We made a stop near the airport for one last potty break for my dog before the flight. 

At the airport curb, we quickly put the crate back together. My friend loaded it on an airport cart - the crate was unproportionally large for the cart, but it somehow worked. Together, we took the crate, my luggage and my dog who was on leash to the Lufthansa economy check in counter. My dog was totally enjoying this new experience - a huge room filled with people, blissfully unaware of what I had planned for his next 24 hours. The airline agents checked his NOC certificate, rabies vaccination certificate, acclimation certificate and then the crate. They confirmed that everything looked good and affixed more stickers on the crate. My friend and I looked at each other relieved.  

Focus then shifted to my documents and we found out that I needed a transit visa to travel through Germany, even if I was only going to be inside the airport during the layover. The expired visa stamping in my passport or the supplemental documentation that proved my US visa was still valid were not enough. There was nothing we could do, I had to go back to Cincinnati and make new plans. I felt crushed, my friend was heartbroken for me. She drove another 7 hours to take us back home. We hit some intense fog on the way back but reached home safe. The day became memorable for so many reasons.

<br/>
While preparing for my dog's travel, I was constantly searching for resources that covered all aspects of the process at the required level of detail. But beyond high level articles published by pet relocation companies, I could not find much. Hence this post, to document the process and experience from the perspective of a dog owner in hopes that it will help someone in the future.  

Finally, a huge shoutout to my family and my Cincinnati friends - Ben, Chris, Bryson, Katie, Bryson Jr., Dottie, Gene, Justin, Stephanie, Kaytie, Spencer. Thank you for standing by me throughout this difficult experience. My first ever blog post is dedicated to you guys!
