title: Flying your large breed dog internationally as excess baggage
---

A couple of months ago, I found out I had to move from the USA to India temporarily. I had no idea how long 'temporary' was. A dog owner's nightmare! After much thought, I decided to take my 65 pound golden retriever with me to India in an airplane as excess baggage. I spent the following months preparing for our journey and trying to make sure I had everything needed to ensure a smooth travel for my dog. On the day of our flight, my dog's documents were checked by the airlines' employees and he was ready to be boarded. Great! They looked at my passport and asked me for a transit visa that I didn't have. Not great! Unfortunately, we could not fly that day. So, while I cannot tell you what happens after checking in your dog in an international flight, I can definitely take you through what happened before that. 

I. Manifest Cargo vs Excess Baggage

There are two options to fly with your dog internationally - excess baggage and manifest cargo. With excess baggage, the dog is linked to the owner's flight booking. With manifest cargo, the dog needs a separate booking. Airlines usually require a professional pet relocation company to do the booking. The company handles the entire process on your behalf, making this the least stressful and the most expensive option. For my situation, I chose excess cargo with Lufthansa airlines. When I booked my flight ticket, I requested a spot for my dog. After confirming there was space available in the cargo, the agent asked a couple of questions about my dog, size of his crate etc. and added my dog to the ticket. My dog's reservation was also mentioned on the itinerary emailed to me.

Each airline has its own rules and restrictions regarding dog breed, dog weight, size of the crate etc. Some airlines even require live animals to be transported only as manifest cargo. It is important to make the reservation as early as possible to avoid last minute surprises.
 

II. Choosing the right departure location

I live in Cincinnati, but I did not choose to fly from the closest airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG). Two big reasons for this: 

i. To avoid multiple airline and codeshare flights

During international travel, it is common to have multiple airlines involved. But pet travel policies are specific to the airlines operating the flight and it is the pet owner's responsibility to confirm that all airlines involved are ready to fly the pet. Every flight option from CVG involved multiple airlines. A six hour drive to Chicago sounded less stressful, so I made my reservation to fly from the Chicago airport. 

ii. Weather

A couple of days after I made the flight reservation, I learnt about 'weather embargoes'. Airlines have temperature restrictions to ensure the safety of pets during extreme weather conditions. If the temperature goes above or below safe levels, the airline can refuse to fly the pet. This is to avoid exposing the pet to harsh temperatures while moving him or her between the terminal and the aircraft. Breeds tolerant to cold weather might be allowed to fly with an acclimation certificate from a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved vet. But in dangerously cold conditions, the airlines can still refuse to fly them. And weather embargoes apply to both departure and destination locations.

Flying from the Windy city during January sounded like the perfect recipe for a cold weather embargo. So I decided to go down south and fly from Atlanta, where the temperature was forecasted to be in the 50s on the day of our flight.  

 
II. CRATE

i. Figuring out the right crate size

After quickly realizing that the foldable metal crate I had lying at home, unused in a long time, cannot be used for flying, I looked for a plastic crate specifically built for air travel. I used the standard formula https://www.iata.org/contentassets/b0016da92c86449f850fe9560827bbea/pet-container-requirements.pdf to calculate the size for my dog. My golden retriever weighs around 65 pounds, but he is longer than most dogs weighing the same. For his dimensions, the 48 inch crate https://www.petmate.com/petmate-sky-kennel/product/PM09 was the suitable choice. The monstrosity of the crate and the logistic challenges involved were intimidating. But as someone who is claustrophobic when flying on airplanes, I knew there was no such thing as 'too much space' during a ~24 hour journey in the dark cargo hold.    

ii. Getting your dog used to the crate

My dog hates the crate. Period. I knew he was never going to completely like his new plastic crate but I had a couple of months to atleast make him feel not-uncomfortable in it. I started feeding all his meals inside the crate and dropped a lot of treats. The usual crate training stuff. 

iii. Preparing the crate for the flight 

The crate came with the 'Live Animals' stickers and a form to indicate when the animal was last fed. I stuck the 'Live Animal' stickers on the front and sides. I found a couple of videos on YouTube for guidance. There were also two small plastic bowls that came with the crate - one for food and one for water. I thought they were too small for the ~24 hour journey and bought bigger ones https://www.petsmart.com/dog/bowls-and-feeders/top-paw-crate-crock-feeding-bowl-51192.html?cgid=100402&fmethod=Browse (2.5 cups). I attached them to the crate door. I lined the bottom of the crate with pee pads in case there are potty accidents and put a blanket I was using for the past few days on top, hoping my scent would be comforting in the dark and noisy cargo hold.
