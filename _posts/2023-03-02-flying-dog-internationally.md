title: Flying your dog internationally as excess baggage
---

A couple of months ago, I found out I had to move from the USA to India temporarily. I had no idea how long 'temporary' was. A dog owner's nightmare! After much thought, I decided to take my 65 pound golden retriever with me to India. I learnt there were two options - excess baggage and manifest cargo. With excess baggage, the dog is linked to the owner's flight booking. With manifest cargo, the dog needs a separate booking, and airlines usually require a professional pet relocation company to do the booking. The company handles the entire process on your behalf, making this the least stressful and the most expensive option. For my situation, I chose excess cargo. I spent the following months preparing for our journey and trying to make sure I had everything needed to ensure a smooth travel for my dog. On the day of our flight, my dog's documents were checked by the airlines' employees and he was ready to be boarded. Great! They looked at my passport and asked me for a transit visa that I didn't have. Not great! Unfortunately, we could not fly. So, while I cannot tell you what happens after checking your dog in, I can definitely take you through what happens before that.
